    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 20px">Comparing information between places can be of paramount importance when making 
        decisions. However, viewing information across locations can often be difficult without user interaction or be specific to 
        certain locations and information. As a solution to this problem, the GeoComp dashboard was developed. It uses R programming 
        language, along with Shiny framework to facilitate the visualization of comparisons between locations in a friendly interface
        and allowing the user to choose which graphics and which information of the places will be visualized. With information 
        entered by the user, it is possible to visualize them in: map with color break, bar graph, radar graph and correlation 
        matrix. The tests were performed using geographical information between countries, states, cities and farms, demonstrating 
        the scope of the tool. For all these tests, the app presented satisfactory visual and performance results, allowing greater 
        visual and graphical analysis of the tested locations. It is expected that this tool will be used by all types of users to 
        make comparisons between places and visualize geographical data in a more simplified way, helping decision making and 
        scientific analysis.</p>
